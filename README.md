# Forex Investment Simulation

This repository provides a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to:
1. **Load and inspect** Excel exchange-rate data (AUD, USD, EUR vs IDR).
2. **Compute moving-average forecasts** based on data in 2024 to predict January 2025 rates.
3. **Simulate an investment** of IDR 25,000,000 into each currency at the start of January 2025.
4. **Track daily IDR value** of the holdings through January 2025.
5. **Visualize** the performance of each currency investment over time and compare final outcomes.
